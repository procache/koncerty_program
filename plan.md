# Plan

> Claude executes tasks from here. Update by ticking `[ ] ‚Üí [x]` when complete.
> Claude may only tick after GREEN (tests/build pass, git clean).


## Overall

**Project Goal:** Fully automated web scraper for concert programs from 26 music venues in Prague and Plze≈à.

**Requirements:**
- Run monthly: `python scrape_concerts.py` ‚Üí generates events_data.json
- Generate HTML page: sorted by date, with venue URLs, city filtering
- Music only (exclude theatre, sports)
- Must work WITHOUT Claude interaction (Playwright-based, not WebFetch)

**Current Month:** November 2025

**üìÖ Session Status (2025-10-23):**
- ‚úÖ Completed today: MeetFactory (infinite scroll fix), Malostransk√° beseda, Reduta Jazz Club
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Deferred: U Star√© Pan√≠ (website down), Lucerna Velk√Ω s√°l (no November events), Cross Club (complex JS)
- üéØ Next to implement: **Watt Music Club** (Batch 3)
- üìä Progress: 10/26 venues (38%), 233 events
- üíæ Git: All commits pushed to origin/main
- üîÑ Resume command: Continue with Watt Music Club from Batch 3

---

## Now - Playwright-Based Automation (CRITICAL PATH)

**üéØ Goal:** FULLY AUTOMATED monthly scraping - no manual intervention needed

**Strategy:** Playwright for JavaScript sites ‚Üí Beautiful Soup for static HTML ‚Üí Fail gracefully

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RULE: NO WebFetch allowed!**
- WebFetch requires Claude interaction = NOT AUTOMATED
- All scrapers MUST use Playwright or Beautiful Soup ONLY
- WebFetch is deprecated and only kept for debugging reference
