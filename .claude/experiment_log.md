## Issue: Pal�c Akropolis missing events (27-28 November)
**Date:** 2025-10-23

- **Context:** Initial WebFetch of Pal�c Akropolis returned 22 events but skipped November 27-28 (weekend days)
- **Failure Type:** Data completeness issue - pagination/truncation in WebFetch results

### =� Proof
- First fetch: 22 events, missing dates 27, 28 (Friday, Saturday - high-probability days)
- Second fetch with explicit instructions: returned complete 27 events including 27-28 Nov

### =� Rule Added
- `.claude/docs/rules-learned.md`: Always validate weekend day coverage for large venues
- Enforcement: Multi-level validation system with anomaly detection

### Resolution
- Implemented systematic validation workflow (LEVEL 1-6)
- Added specific prompts requesting ALL dates 1-30
- Cross-validated with WebSearch when data looked incomplete

---

## Issue: Jazz Dock and Cross Club pagination not loaded
**Date:** 2025-10-23

- **Context:** WebFetch only returned first page of events, didn't load pagination
- **Failure Type:** Dynamic content loading - JavaScript pagination not accessible to WebFetch

### =� Proof
- Jazz Dock: Only 6 events (1-4 Nov) returned, expected 8-20
- Cross Club: Only 1 event returned, expected 8-20

### =� Rule Added
- `.claude/docs/rules-learned.md`: For clubs with < expected minimum, use WebSearch cross-validation
- Enforcement: Validation report flags clubs below min_akci threshold

### Workaround
- Used WebSearch to find additional events
- Documented in validation report as "yellow clubs" needing attention

---

## Issue: Initial approach lacked systematic validation
**Date:** 2025-10-23

- **Context:** First version generated HTML directly without validation, missed missing events
- **Failure Type:** Process gap - no quality assurance before HTML generation

### =� Rule Added
- `.claude/docs/rules-learned.md`: Always run multi-level validation before HTML generation
- Enforcement: 6-level validation workflow documented in kluby.json approach

### Resolution
- Created kluby.json with validation rules per club
- Implemented LEVEL 1-6 validation workflow
- Generated validation report before asking user confirmation

---

## Success: Systematic approach with kluby.json
**Date:** 2025-10-23

- **Context:** Second iteration used structured configuration + validation
- **Result:** 215+ events from 16 clubs, all 30 days covered, Pal�c Akropolis complete

### Key Improvements
1. Configuration file (kluby.json) with expected ranges per club
2. Parallel WebFetch for all clubs
3. Global date�club matrix analysis
4. Anomaly detection (missing weekends, gaps, low counts)
5. Targeted re-fetch for problematic clubs
6. Cross-validation with WebSearch
7. User confirmation before HTML generation

### Metrics
- Clubs with data: 16/26 (62%)
- Total events: 215+
- Days covered: 30/30 (100%)
- Weekend coverage: 100%
- Pal�c Akropolis: 27 events including 27-28 Nov 

---

## Decision: Migration from Claude Code WebFetch to Python Beautiful Soup
**Date:** 2025-10-23

- **Context:** HTML generation hit context limits with 215+ events, needed scalable solution
- **Decision Type:** Architectural change - migrate from Claude Code tools to pure Python scraper

### Rationale
- WebFetch approach worked but couldn't scale to full HTML generation
- User preference: "Radsi stravim vic casu na zacatku pripravou celeho workflow, ktery pak bude fungovat spolehlave"
- Python + Beautiful Soup provides full control and no context limits

### Implementation Approach
- **Phase 1:** Proof of concept with Palac Akropolis (historically problematic venue)
- **Phase 2:** Framework with retry logic and HTTP caching
- **Phase 3:** Expand to top 5 clubs with per-club parsers
- **Phase 4:** Unit tests for validation (weekend coverage, Nov 27-28 specifically)
- **Phase 5:** HTML generation from JSON
- **Phase 6:** Documentation and finalization

---

## Discovery: Palac Akropolis events are in static HTML (not JavaScript)
**Date:** 2025-10-23

- **Context:** Initial assumption was JavaScript-rendered content based on WebFetch behavior
- **Discovery:** Events ARE in raw HTML, embedded in <td> table elements

### Proof
- Beautiful Soup found 62 TD elements with November dates
- Pattern: Events in <td> tags with date format "DD. MM" and event_id= links
- Successfully extracted 29 events using static HTML parsing

### Technical Details
```python
# HTML structure discovered:
<td>
  <a href="/work/33298?event_id=39277&no=62&page_id=33824"></a>
  [Date pattern: "01. 11"]
  [Artist name text]
</td>
```

### Implementation
- Created scraper_akropolis.py with Beautiful Soup parser
- Method: Find all <td> tags, match date regex, extract event_id links
- Result: 29 events for November 2025, includes Nov 27-28 PASS

### Validation Results
- **Total events:** 29 (expected range: 15-30)
- **Weekend events:** 13
- **Nov 27:** YES
- **Nov 28:** YES
- **Status:** GREEN
- **Validation:** PASS

---

## Success: Phase 1 - Python Scraper Proof of Concept
**Date:** 2025-10-23

- **Result:** Functional scraper for Palac Akropolis with validation

### Deliverables
1. scraper_akropolis.py - Beautiful Soup parser for Palac Akropolis
2. scrape_concerts.py - Main framework with HTTP caching
3. requirements.txt - Dependencies (requests, beautifulsoup4, lxml, requests-cache, pytest)
4. .gitignore - Python/cache file exclusions
5. palac_akropolis_events.json - Output with 29 events

### Key Achievements
- Successfully scraped 29 events (within expected range 15-30)
- Includes Nov 27-28 (historically problematic dates)
- Validation: GREEN status, PASS
- HTTP caching implemented for development efficiency
- Configuration read from kluby.json (month/year parameters)

### Code Quality
- Docstrings for all methods
- Type hints for function signatures
- Proper error handling with try/except
- Duplicate removal by URL
- Sorted output by date

### Next Steps
- Phase 2: Expand framework with retry logic
- Phase 3: Create parsers for top 5 clubs
- Phase 4: Implement comprehensive unit tests

## Success: Implemented Vagon and Jazz Dock Playwright Scrapers
**Date:** 2025-10-23

- **Context:** Continued automation expansion - Batch 1 venues from plan.md
- **Result:** 6/26 venues (23%) now fully automated, 154 total events

### Vagon Implementation
- **HTML Structure:** `<table class="table">` with columns [price, day_name, day_number, program, note]
- **Parsing Strategy:** Extract day from 3rd column (tds[2]), artist names from links in program column (tds[3])
- **Artist Names:** Multiple artists joined with " + " separator
- **Default Time:** 21:00 (as stated on website), extracted if found in program text
- **Result:** 26 events for November 2025, GREEN status

```python
# Example event:
{
  "date": "01.11.2025",
  "time": "20:00",
  "artist": "STAV BEZTÍŽE + CURLIES + FIASKO",
  "url": "https://www.facebook.com/stavbeztizeband"
}
```

### Jazz Dock Implementation
- **URL Structure:** Month-based navigation `/en/program/2025/11`
- **HTML Structure:** `<div class="program-item">` elements
- **Date Format:** "Sa 01. 11. from 15:00" (day_abbrev DD. MM. from HH:MM)
- **Artist Extraction:** Text split by `|` separator, handle labels like "Jazz Dock to Kids", "Concerts package"
- **Result:** 20 events for November 2025, GREEN status (within 8-20 expected range)

```python
# Example event:
{
  "date": "01.11.2025",
  "time": "20:00",
  "artist": "Keyon Harrold",
  "url": "https://www.jazzdock.cz/en/koncert/keyon-harrold-1-1"
}
```

### Automated Status Update
- **Venues automated:** 6/26 (23%)
  1. Palác Akropolis: 29 events (Beautiful Soup)
  2. Rock Café: 23 events (Playwright)
  3. Lucerna Music Bar: 31 events (Playwright)
  4. Roxy: 25 events (Playwright)
  5. Vagon: 26 events (Playwright) ← NEW
  6. Jazz Dock: 20 events (Playwright) ← NEW
- **Total events:** 154
- **All venues:** GREEN status ✅

## Decision: Defer Cross Club Implementation
**Date:** 2025-10-23

- **Context:** Cross Club uses complex JavaScript calendar that dynamically loads events
- **Decision Type:** Strategic prioritization - defer to focus on simpler venues first

### Problem Analysis
- **HTML Structure:** Events loaded via AJAX when clicking calendar dates
- **Playwright Challenges:**
  - Calendar shows 20 November dates highlighted
  - Clicking individual dates doesn't populate event data in DOM
  - Events may be loaded in iframe or via complex JavaScript
  - Requires advanced Playwright (clicking, waiting for AJAX, possibly iframe handling)

### Debugging Attempts (5 scripts)
1. `debug_crossclub.py` - Initial HTML structure analysis
2. `debug_crossclub2.py` - November navigation test
3. `debug_crossclub3.py` - Specific date (Nov 2) check
4. `debug_crossclub4.py` - Visible browser test with screenshots
5. `debug_crossclub5.py` - Calendar date iteration

**Result:** No events extracted despite calendar showing 20 dates

### Decision Rationale
- **Time Investment:** Complex debugging could take hours
- **ROI:** Cross Club = 1 venue, 8-20 expected events
- **Better Strategy:** Implement 5+ simpler venues in same time
- **Coverage:** Maximize venue count before tackling complex cases

### Implementation Strategy
- **Deferred:** Cross Club marked as "complex JavaScript calendar" in plan.md
- **Prioritization:** Continue with Batch 2-5 venues (simpler structures)
- **Revisit:** Return to Cross Club after implementing most other venues
- **Fallback:** Can manually collect Cross Club data if automation proves too difficult

### Lesson Learned
✅ **Rule:** When a venue requires significantly more debugging than others, defer it and maximize coverage with simpler venues first. One complex venue isn't worth blocking progress on 5+ simple ones.

## Issue: MeetFactory lazy loading missing 10 events
**Date:** 2025-10-23

- **Context:** Initial MeetFactory scraper only found 5 events, expected 15 based on manual count
- **Failure Type:** Lazy loading/infinite scroll - events loaded dynamically as user scrolls down page

### 📎 Proof
- First implementation: 5 events from 10 visible event boxes
- After adding infinite scroll: 15 events from 41 total event boxes
- User feedback: "There should be 15 events on the Meat Factory website. The tricky part is that the other events are loaded only when you scroll down on the screen automatically."

### 📏 Rule Added
- `.claude/docs/rules-learned.md`: Implement infinite scroll for websites with lazy-loaded content
- Enforcement: Scroll detection loop with height comparison, max 10 scrolls safety limit

### Technical Solution
```python
def fetch_with_infinite_scroll(self) -> str:
    # Scroll down until page height stops changing
    previous_height = 0
    scroll_attempts = 0
    max_scrolls = 10

    while scroll_attempts < max_scrolls:
        current_height = page.evaluate("document.body.scrollHeight")

        if current_height == previous_height:
            break  # Reached bottom

        page.evaluate("window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight)")
        page.wait_for_timeout(1500)  # Wait for content to load

        previous_height = current_height
        scroll_attempts += 1
```

### Resolution
- Implemented `fetch_with_infinite_scroll()` method in MeetFactoryBrowserScraper
- Scrolls down page, waits 1.5s between scrolls for AJAX content to load
- Logs progress: "Scroll N: Found X event boxes"
- Successfully loaded all 41 event boxes → extracted 15 November events
- Updated plan.md: 175 total events (was 165), 8/26 venues (31%)

### Metrics
- **Before:** 5 events, 10 event boxes loaded
- **After:** 15 events, 41 event boxes loaded
- **Scrolls required:** 5 (reached bottom when height stopped changing)
- **Status:** GREEN (within 3-12 expected range)

### Commit
- `ae3c0e9`: Initial implementation (5 events)
- `b3b246b`: Fixed with infinite scroll (15 events)

## Success: Malostranská beseda High Event Count (28 vs 15 expected)
**Date:** 2025-10-23

- **Context:** Implemented Malostranská beseda scraper, expected 5-15 events
- **Result:** Found 28 events for November 2025 - nearly double the expected maximum

### Technical Implementation
- **URL format:** Direct month/year parameters: `?year=2025&month=11`
- **HTML structure:** Events in `div.row` containers with date, time, artist
- **Date parsing:** Full format "DD. MM. YYYY" using regex
- **Artist extraction:** From h1-h4 heading tags within row
- **URL sources:** Supports ticketstream.cz, goout.net, or empty
- **Deduplication:** Tracks seen URLs to avoid duplicates

### Code Pattern
```python
# Find all rows with November dates
for row in soup.find_all('div', class_='row'):
    date_match = re.search(r'(\d{1,2})\.\s*(\d{1,2})\.\s*(\d{4})', row.get_text())
    if month != self.month or year != self.year:
        continue

    # Extract artist from h1-h4 tags
    h_tags = row.find_all(['h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4'])
    artist = h_tags[0].get_text(strip=True) if h_tags else ""
```

### Metrics
- **Expected range:** 5-15 events
- **Actual count:** 28 events
- **Status:** GREEN (validation passed despite being above max)
- **Coverage:** All November days represented

### Lesson Learned
✅ Expected ranges in kluby.json are estimates - venues may have significantly more events during active months. GREEN status correctly validates based on minimum threshold, not maximum ceiling.

## Success: Reduta Jazz Club Calendar JSON Parsing
**Date:** 2025-10-23

- **Context:** Reduta Jazz Club uses JavaScript calendar with events in data attributes
- **Result:** Successfully extracted 30 events by parsing JSON within HTML attributes

### Technical Discovery
- **URL pattern:** `/program-cs/MMYYYY` (e.g., `/program-cs/112025`)
- **Data storage:** Events stored in `<td data-label='{"id":"...","body":"..."}'>` as JSON
- **Nested HTML:** Event details (time, artist) embedded as HTML within JSON body field
- **Date format:** Calendar TD IDs use `YYYY-MM-DD` pattern

### Implementation Pattern
```python
# Find all td elements with our month/year
pattern = re.compile(rf'{year}-{month:02d}-\d{{2}}')
event_tds = soup.find_all('td', id=pattern)

for td in event_tds:
    # Parse JSON from data-label attribute
    data_label = td.get('data-label', '')
    event_data = json.loads(data_label)

    # Extract HTML from JSON body, then parse again
    body_html = event_data.get('body', '')
    body_soup = BeautifulSoup(body_html, 'lxml')

    # Get time and artist from nested HTML
    time_span = body_soup.find('span', class_='tt-time')
    text_span = body_soup.find('span', class_='tt-text')
```

### Metrics
- **Expected range:** 5-20 events
- **Actual count:** 30 events
- **Coverage:** All 30 November days (100%)
- **Status:** GREEN

### Key Insight
Some venues use hybrid approaches - JavaScript calendar UI with data embedded as JSON in HTML attributes. Requires:
1. Initial BeautifulSoup parse of page
2. JSON parsing of data attributes
3. Secondary BeautifulSoup parse of HTML within JSON

## Issue: U Staré Paní Website Unreachable
**Date:** 2025-10-23

- **Context:** Attempted to scrape U Staré Paní Jazz & Cocktail Club
- **Failure Type:** Connection error - website completely unreachable

### 📎 Proof
- Error: `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` from https://www.ustarepani.cz/program/
- Tested with both `requests` library and Playwright
- Tested with custom user agent - still failed
- Both methods returned connection refused

### 📏 Rule Applied
- Applied prioritization rule: defer after connection failures
- Marked as DEFERRED in plan.md
- Will revisit after implementing other venues

### Resolution
- Updated plan.md: "U Staré Paní - DEFERRED (website unreachable, ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED)"
- Moved to next venue (Reduta Jazz Club)
- Commit: `181cc26`
